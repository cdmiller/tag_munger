Tag Munger

This is the project where I am taking the monolithic, scripts that
were used to "fix" the tape library for better Sonos use and making 
them into a usable class library with usable executables.

First project is the tag_munger executable which allows some basic browsing
and "fixing" of the album tags so that the are grouped by course day.

As a reminder: We muck about with the album tags for the tape library files so 
that we can mimic the minidisc setup, where each day is its own disk/album.
